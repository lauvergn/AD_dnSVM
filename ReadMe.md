# AD_dnSVM

 **AD_dnSVM** is a Fortran Automatic Differentiation library using forward mode for scalars.
 Its features are:
 - no limit in terms of the number of independent variables (this number is defined at runtime)
 - up to third derivatives

It is similar to Auto_Deriv fortran module: http://www.autodiff.org/?module=Tools&tool=AUTO_DERIV

## 1) Utilisation:

This library enables to get the derivatives (up to third order) of a
function of several variables (type(dnS_t)).
See the APP/Example_dnS.f90 file.

### 1a) Variables need to be initialized, for instance the variables, X, Y, Z:

```
  USE ADdnSVM_dnSVM_m
  IMPLICIT NONE
  !....

  type(dnS_t) :: X,Y,Z
  type(dnS_t) :: f

  X = Variable( Val=HALF, nVar=3, iVar=1, nderiv=1 )
  Y = Variable( Val=ONE,  nVar=3, iVar=2, nderiv=1 )
  Z = Variable( Val=TWO,  nVar=3, iVar=3, nderiv=1 )
```

X, Y and Z are, respectively, the first, the second and the third variables (iVar)
among 3 (nVar).
Their derivatives are defined up to the 1st order (nderiv=1).
The variable values are set with Val.

Remark: for Y, it value is ONE, the three 1st derivatives are [ZERO,ONE,ZERO]
and all 2d derivatives are null.


Operations with X, Y and Z:
```
f = ONE + cos(X)**2 + sin(Y*Z)
```
 f value   : 1. + cos(0.5)**2 + sin(2.) = 2.679448580
 f gradient: [-2. * sin(0.5)*cos(0.5), 2. * cos(2.),   cos(2.)] =
             [-0.8414709848,          -0.8322936731, -0.4161468365]
```
CALL Write_dnS(f,info='f=1.0 + cos(X)**2 + sin(Y*Z), value: 2.67945')
```
gives:

 f=1.0 + cos(X)**2 + sin(Y*Z), value: 2.67945
 0   derivative            +0.268E+01
 1st derivative  1         -0.841E+00
 1st derivative  2         -0.832E+00
 1st derivative  3         -0.416E+00

### 1b) Initialization with a vector and Jacobian matrix

```
  USE ADdnSVM_dnSVM_m
  IMPLICIT NONE
  !....

  type(dnS_t), allocatable :: VecOld(:),VecNew(:)

  r  = TWO
  th = Pi/3
  VecOld = Variable([r,th], nderiv=2 )                ! VecOld(1) : r, VecOld(2) : th
  VecNew = VecOld(1)*[cos(VecOld(2)),sin(VecOld(2))]  ! [r*cos(th), r*sin(th)]

  JacNewOld = get_Jacobian( VecNew )                  ! JacNewOld(inew,iold)=[ dQinew/dQiold ]
```

## 2) Installation
With **fpm**
```
    fpm build
```

with a **makefile**:

```
    make all
```

It will make the library, the executable tests and example.

The library, **libAD_dnSVM.a**, is in the main directory.
The .mod files are need. They are in the OBJ directory

## 3) run the tests
With **fpm**

```
    fpm test dnPoly
    fpm test dnS
```
with a **makefile**:
```
    make ut
```

or in the Tests directory, run the scripts:
```
    ./run_test_dnS
    ./run_test_dnPoly
```
or in the Tests directory, run the script
```
    ./run_tests
```

## 4) run the example
With **fpm**
```
    fpm run Exa_dnS
````
or in the main directory
```
    ./Exa_dnS.x
```
